Input is data given to an algorithm. An algorithm is a series of steps that returns some result. An algorithm may be influenced by its environment, and it may produce side-effects which influence its environment.
An algorithm is set of steps to solve a general problem, Finite, Can handle a problem of arbitrary size
Pseudocode: simple and readable version of algorithm that resembles code
Assignment Operator: Assigns a variable some value (a=2)
Loop Statement: Repeatedly performs an action a fixed number of times
Relational Operator: Compares two values (a>b)
Conditional Statement: If statement that only performs an action under certain conditions 
Function: Generalizes code to work for a generic input 
“REPL” “Read Execute Print Loop”
